        <p>Hi there! My name is Palesa, and I'm from the beautiful country of South Africa. I'm on a journey to become a software developer, fueled by my passion for technology and innovation.</p>
        <p>Previously, I worked as a civil draughtsman, but I realized that I was longing for more growth and fulfillment in my career.</p>
        <p>One of the guiding lights in my life has been my faith. I've been a member of the church since I can remember, and I'm incredibly thankful for the opportunities that the Lord has bestowed upon me, including the chance to pursue education again.</p>
        <p>Join me as I embark on this exciting new chapter in my life!</p>
